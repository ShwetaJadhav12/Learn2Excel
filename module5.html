        <!-- Types of Irrigation Systems -->
        <div class="card1">
            <h2>Types of Irrigation Systems</h2>
            <p>Various irrigation methods are adopted depending on water availability, terrain, and crop type.</p>

            <!-- Surface Irrigation -->
            <div class="sub-card">
                <h3>Surface Irrigation</h3>
                <p>Water is supplied to the field’s surface using channels or furrows.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Methods</strong>: Flood irrigation, furrow irrigation, basin irrigation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Suitable Crops</strong>: Rice, wheat, sugarcane, cotton.</li>
                    <li><strong>Challenges</strong>: Water wastage, uneven distribution in sloped areas.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <!-- Drip Irrigation -->
            <div class="sub-card">
                <h3>Drip Irrigation</h3>
                <p>Water is delivered directly to the plant roots via tubes and emitters.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Advantages</strong>: Conserves water, reduces waste, efficient for water-sensitive crops.</li>
                    <li><strong>Suitable Crops</strong>: Fruits, vegetables, high-water-requirement crops.</li>
                    <li><strong>Challenges</strong>: High installation cost.</li>

            </div>

            <!-- Sprinkler Irrigation -->
            <div class="sub-card">
                <h3>Sprinkler Irrigation</h3>
                <p>Water is sprayed through sprinklers, mimicking rainfall.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Advantages</strong>: Useful for uneven terrain, provides uniform water distribution.</li>
                    <li><strong>Suitable Crops</strong>: Wheat, maize, vegetables, fruits.</li>
                    <li><strong>Challenges</strong>: Affected by wind, higher water usage than drip irrigation.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <!-- Subsurface Irrigation -->
            <div class="sub-card">
                <h3>Subsurface Irrigation</h3>
                <p>Water is delivered below the surface directly to the roots through buried pipes.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Advantages</strong>: Reduces evaporation, minimizes weed growth, efficient for high-value crops.</li>
                    <li><strong>Suitable Crops</strong>: Orchards, vineyards, vegetables.</li>
                    <li><strong>Challenges</strong>: Expensive to install.</li>

                <h3>Rainwater Harvesting</h3>
                <p>Collecting and storing rainwater for use during dry periods.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Advantages</strong>: Sustainable, eco-friendly, reduces dependence on groundwater.</li>
                    <li><strong>Challenges</strong>: Requires infrastructure and adequate rainfall.</li>

        <!-- Watering Tips for Gardening -->
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Watering Tips for Gardening</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Deep Watering</strong>: Water deeply rather than shallow watering. Deep watering encourages roots to grow deeper, making plants more drought-resistant.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering Can or Drip Irrigation</strong>: Use a watering can or drip irrigation system for precise watering, which reduces water wastage.</li>
                <li><strong>Consider Local Climate</strong>: Adjust watering schedules based on local weather and plant types. For example, during hot weather, you may need to water more frequently.</li>
