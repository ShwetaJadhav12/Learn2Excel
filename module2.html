<!-- Introduction to Types of Soil -->
<div class="intro-section">
  <h2>Types of Soil</h2>
  <p>
    Soil is a vital component of agriculture and gardening, providing nutrients, water, and support for plant growth. Different types of soil have unique properties that affect how plants grow. Understanding the type of soil helps in selecting suitable plants and improving soil quality for better yield and health.

      <img src="sandy1.png" alt="Sandy Soil" />
      <div class="card-content">
        <h2>Sandy Soil</h2>
        <p>Sandy soil has large particles and feels gritty. It drains quickly but has low nutrient retention. Ideal for plants that prefer dry conditions.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Clay Soil -->
    <div class="card">
      <img src="clay.png" alt="Clay Soil" />
      <div class="card-content">
        <h2>Clay Soil</h2>
        <p>Clay soil has small particles, which makes  it heavy and compact. It retains water well but may cause root rot due to poor drainage. Adding organic matter helps improve its structure.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Silt Soil -->
    <div class="card">
      <img src="slit.png" alt="Silt Soil" />
      <div class="card-content">
        <h2>Silt Soil</h2>
        <p>Silt has fine particles and holds moisture better than sandy soil. It's more fertile than sandy soil but prone to compaction.</p>

  <h2>Introduction to Soil Testing</h2>
  <p>
    Soil testing is essential for understanding the nutrient content and overall health of the soil. 
    It helps determine the soil's pH level, nutrient deficiencies, and organic matter content. 
    By testing the soil, farmers and gardeners can adjust fertilization, improve soil structure, 
    and enhance crop yield. Regular soil testing ensures that plants receive the right nutrients, 
    promoting healthier growth and sustainable farming practices.

  <!-- Why is Soil Testing Important? -->
  <div class="card">
      <h2>Why is Soil Testing Important?</h2>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Optimizing Plant Growth:</strong> Soil tests help determine the nutrient levels and pH of the soil, allowing farmers and gardeners to make informed decisions about fertilization and soil amendments to optimize plant growth.</li>
          <li><strong>Identifying Problems:</strong> Soil tests can identify nutrient deficiencies, imbalances, or other issues that may be affecting plant health and yield.</li>
          <li><strong>Environmental Protection:</strong> Soil testing can help assess the presence of contaminants or other environmental concerns, allowing for appropriate management and remediation.</li>

  <h1>Composting Methods for Farming and Gardening</h1>
  
  <!-- Farming Composting -->
  <div class="composting-content">
    <h2>Composting for Farming</h2>
    <p>
      Composting in farming is essential for enriching soil health, improving crop yield, and reducing dependency on chemical fertilizers. Here are the key methods used in farming:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Windrow Composting:</strong> Organic waste is placed in long rows and periodically turned to aid decomposition.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Vermicomposting:</strong> Earthworms are used to break down organic matter, producing nutrient-rich worm castings.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Trench Composting:</strong> Organic waste is buried in trenches, allowing it to decompose directly in the soil.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Static Pile Composting:</strong> Organic matter is piled up and left undisturbed, relying on microbial activity for decomposition.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <!-- Gardening Composting -->
  <div class="composting-content">
    <h2>Composting for Gardening</h2>
    <p>
      Home gardening composting helps improve soil fertility and promotes healthy plant growth. Here are some effective methods:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Backyard Composting:</strong> Organic waste from the kitchen and yard is composted in a pile or bin.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Vermicomposting:</strong> Similar to farming, worms are used to create nutrient-rich compost.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Tumbler Composting:</strong> A compost tumbler helps mix organic waste, speeding up the decomposition process.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Bokashi Composting:</strong> Fermented composting using effective microorganisms (EM) to break down waste quickly.
      </li>
