            <h2>Seasonal Farming in India</h2>
            <p>
                Seasonal farming refers to the practice of cultivating different crops based on the seasons and climatic conditions. India has a diverse climate, which allows farmers to grow a variety of crops throughout the year, but it's essential to align crop cultivation with the seasons to maximize productivity and minimize risks.

        <!-- Kharif Season (Monsoon Cropping Season) -->
        <div class="card">
            <h3>Kharif Season (Monsoon Cropping Season)</h3>

        <!-- Crop Rotation in India -->
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Crop Rotation in India</h2>
            <p>
                Crop rotation is the practice of growing different types of crops in the same field over successive seasons to improve soil fertility, control pests and diseases, and optimize yields. This method helps maintain soil health and reduces the dependency on chemical fertilizers and pesticides.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Importance of Crop Rotation -->
        <div class="card">
            <h3>Importance of Crop Rotation</h3>
            <h4>Soil Fertility Management:</h4>
            <p>
                Some crops deplete specific nutrients in the soil, while others replenish them. For example, legumes like peas, beans, and lentils fix nitrogen in the soil, which benefits subsequent crops like wheat and maize.
            </p>
            <h4>Pest and Disease Control:</h4>
            <p>
                Growing the same crop in a field year after year can lead to the buildup of pests and diseases specific to that crop. By rotating crops, pests and diseases are less likely to survive and reproduce, reducing the need for chemical pesticides.
            </p>
            <h4>Weed Control:</h4>
            <p>
                Different crops have different growth habits, which helps in reducing weed competition. For example, a legume crop with a dense canopy can help suppress weeds.
            </p>
            <h4>Increased Yield:</h4>
            <p>
                Crop rotation helps in optimizing the use of the soil, leading to higher yields over time. Different crops have different rooting systems, and rotating them ensures better utilization of nutrients from the soil.
            </p>

            <h3>Common Crop Rotation Systems in India</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Legume-Cereal Rotation:</strong> Example: Wheat or Rice followed by Legumes (Chickpea, Peas, Soybean, etc.).</li>
                <li><strong>Cereal-Oilseed Rotation:</strong> Example: Rice followed by Mustard or Soybean.</li>
                <li><strong>Cotton-Soybean Rotation:</strong> Example: Cotton followed by Soybean.</li>
                <li><strong>Rice-Wheat Rotation:</strong> Example: Rice followed by Wheat.</li>

        <!-- Benefits of Crop Rotation -->
        <div class="card">
            <h3>Benefits of Crop Rotation in India</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sustainable Agriculture:</strong> Crop rotation ensures that soil fertility is maintained without the need for excessive chemical fertilizers.</li>
                <li><strong>Economic Efficiency:</strong> By reducing the cost of fertilizers and pesticides, crop rotation increases the overall profitability of the farm.</li>
                <li><strong>Water Conservation:</strong> Some crops like legumes require less water than others, allowing farmers to use water more efficiently by rotating crops with different water requirements.</li>
                <li><strong>Risk Mitigation:</strong> If one crop fails due to pests, diseases, or market fluctuations, the subsequent crop in the rotation may succeed, providing economic stability for farmers.</li>

        <!-- Challenges in Implementing Crop Rotation in India -->
        <div class="card">
            <h3>Challenges in Implementing Crop Rotation in India</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Lack of Awareness:</strong> Many farmers in India are still unaware of the benefits of crop rotation and often follow monocropping practices, which can lead to soil degradation and pest buildup.</li>
                <li><strong>Water Dependency:</strong> Some crops require more water than others, making it difficult to implement effective rotation in regions where irrigation resources are limited.</li>
                <li><strong>Market Demands:</strong> Farmers may face market pressure to grow a specific crop repeatedly if there is high demand or a better price, even if crop rotation is beneficial.</li>
                <li><strong>Land Tenure Issues:</strong> In regions with small landholdings, farmers may struggle to implement crop rotation due to constraints in land availability and financial resources.</li>
            </ul>
