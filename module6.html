            <h2>Pest and Disease Control for Farming and Gardening in India</h2>
            <p>
                Effective pest and disease control are essential for ensuring healthy crops and plants in both farming and gardening. Pests and diseases can cause significant damage, reduce yields, and impact the quality of the produce. In India, with its diverse climatic conditions and agricultural practices, pest and disease management is a critical part of both large-scale farming and home gardening.

            <h4>Pest Control Methods</h4>
            <p><strong>Cultural Control:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crop Rotation</strong> – Prevents the buildup of pest populations by changing the type of crop grown each season.</li>
                <li><strong>Intercropping</strong> – Planting multiple crops together can confuse pests and reduce pest attacks.</li>
                <li><strong>Proper Spacing</strong> – Ensuring plants are well-spaced to allow good airflow can reduce pest infestations.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Biological Control:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Beneficial Insects</strong> – Introducing natural predators (e.g., ladybugs for aphids) to control pest populations.</li>
                <li><strong>Neem Oil</strong> – A natural pesticide that works effectively against pests like aphids, whiteflies, and caterpillars.</li>
                <li><strong>Insecticidal Soap</strong> – Used to control soft-bodied insects without harming beneficial insects.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Chemical Control:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Chemical Pesticides</strong> – In cases of severe pest attacks, chemical pesticides like cypermethrin or malathion are used. However, their usage must be controlled to avoid resistance buildup and environmental damage.</li>
                <li><strong>Organic Pesticides</strong> – Chemicals like garlic or chilli-based sprays that are safer for the environment and beneficial insects.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Physical Barriers:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Netting and Mesh</strong> – Used to protect crops from birds and insects.</li>
                <li><strong>Traps</strong> – Sticky traps and pheromone traps can be used for controlling pests like fruit flies.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="card">
            <h4>Disease Control Methods</h4>
            <p><strong>Cultural Practices:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Good Drainage</strong> – Ensuring that crops are planted in well-drained soils can prevent fungal diseases like root rot and downy mildew.</li>
                <li><strong>Sanitation</strong> – Removing diseased plants and plant debris reduces the spread of diseases.</li>
                <li><strong>Resistant Varieties</strong> – Planting disease-resistant crop varieties that are bred to resist specific pathogens (e.g., rust-resistant wheat).</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Biological Control:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fungicides</strong> – Using bio-fungicides like Trichoderma or Bacillus subtilis that control fungal diseases without harming the environment.</li>
                <li><strong>Beneficial Microorganisms</strong> – Introducing bacteria or fungi that outcompete or inhibit the growth of harmful pathogens.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Chemical Control:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fungicides</strong> – In cases of severe fungal infections, chemical fungicides like copper oxychloride or maneb are used to manage diseases like downy mildew and blight.</li>
                <li><strong>Bactericides</strong> – For bacterial diseases, chemicals like streptomycin may be used to control bacterial wilt and other bacterial infections.</li>
